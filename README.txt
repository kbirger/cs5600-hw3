CS 5600 Homework 3

In this exercise you will write an implementation of a simple
MSDOS-like file system named cs5600fs. The skeleton code provided will
allow you to access this file system via one of two ways: either an
FTP-like command line interface, or as a Linux file system using the
FUSE library.

In addition, a utility is provided to format cs5600fs file systems,
along with test scripts and sample disk images.
